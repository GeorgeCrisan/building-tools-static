Basic Gulp Task Runner Setup

I am using pug to generate html, babel for javascript and sass for css via autoprefixer.

browserSync is watching the files.

You need to run 'npm i' in the command line in order to have node_modules installed accordingly.

Edit the files from src folder as it is suitable to your needs.

Then run 'gulp watch';

Output is generated to the dist folder and it is production ready.
